Browse s3 file and directory loader… we will store the txt file in a bucket=mybucket and load our minio credentials ourselves, also browse how do I handle the output of the python langchain research assistant?

---

To load documents from an AWS S3 file or directory into your Python LangChain research assistant script, you can use the `S3FileLoader` or `S3DirectoryLoader` modules from `langchain_community.document_loaders`.

For an S3 file, your code would look something like this:

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import S3FileLoader
import boto3

# Install boto3 if not already installed
# %pip install --upgrade --quiet boto3

# Initialize the loader with your bucket and file key
loader = S3FileLoader("mybucket", "path/to/myfile.txt")

# Load the document
data = loader.load()
```

For an S3 directory, you would use the `S3DirectoryLoader` like this:

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import S3DirectoryLoader
import boto3

# Install boto3 if not already installed
# %pip install --upgrade --quiet boto3

# Initialize the loader with your bucket and optional prefix
loader = S3DirectoryLoader("mybucket", prefix="path/to/directory")

# Load the documents
data = loader.load()
```

In both cases, you can configure the AWS `boto3` client by passing named arguments like `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` when creating the loader, if your AWS credentials are not set as environment variables.

Regarding handling the output of the Python LangChain research assistant, the loaded data will be in a list of `Document` objects. Each `Document` object typically includes the content, lookup string, and metadata such as the source URL. You can process these documents according to your application's needs, like extracting information, running analysis, or feeding them into other LangChain components for further processing.

For more details and examples, you can refer to the LangChain documentation for [AWS S3 File](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/aws_s3_file) and [AWS S3 Directory](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/aws_s3_directory).

---

Browse Weaviate schema class and write a class for the Document object you’re referring to about LangChain research assistant 

---

To define a schema in Weaviate for a `Document` object similar to the one used in LangChain research assistant, you would create a class in the schema that defines the structure of the `Document`. This class would include properties such as the content, lookup string, and metadata of the document. Here's an example of how this class might look in Python using the Weaviate schema definition:

```python
class_obj = {
    "class": "Document",
    "properties": [
        {
            "name": "content",
            "dataType": ["text"],
        },
        {
            "name": "lookup_str",
            "dataType": ["text"],
        },
        {
            "name": "metadata",
            "dataType": ["text"],
        },
    ],
    "vectorizer": "text2vec-openai"
}

client.schema.create_class(class_obj)
```

In this schema, `content`, `lookup_str`, and `metadata` are defined as properties of the `Document` class, with `text` as their data type. The `vectorizer` is set to use OpenAI's text-to-vector module for generating vector embeddings of the document content. This is just a basic example; depending on your specific needs, you might want to include more properties or configure the vectorizer differently.

For more detailed information on defining schemas in Weaviate, you can refer to the Weaviate documentation [here](https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/zero_to_mvp/schema_and_imports/schema).

Integrating MinIO S3 with Weaviate in a Python LangChain application involves using S3 as a storage pool for documents and Weaviate as a metadata interpreter and search engine. In this setup, you would use S3 to store the actual documents, such as text files, while Weaviate would handle the indexing and querying of the metadata or content of these documents.

To implement this, you'd typically use LangChain to load documents from S3 and then use Weaviate's vector database capabilities to index and query the documents. This allows you to leverage Weaviate's semantic search features for the stored content. The integration can be customized using various techniques like sequential chains, CombineDocuments, and tool use in LangChain, which augment language models to interact with external tools like vector databases or code executors.

For a practical example and detailed guidance on combining LangChain and Weaviate, you can refer to the [Weaviate blog](https://weaviate.io/blog/combining-langchain-and-weaviate). This resource provides insights into building applications that harness the strengths of both LangChain and Weaviate.

  - LangChain can be used to build a pipeline that interfaces with both MinIO and Weaviate. For example, you might retrieve data from MinIO, process it using LangChain's language model capabilities, and then use Weaviate to perform semantic searches on the processed data.

- **Building the Application**:
  - Your application can be built in Python, utilizing the SDKs/APIs provided by MinIO and Weaviate, and integrating them through LangChain. This setup allows you to develop custom functionalities like chatbots, data analysis tools, or any other application that leverages large-scale data storage, advanced search, and language model processing.

### Considerations:

- **Scalability**: Ensure that your application can scale horizontally to handle increasing data volumes and user requests.
- **Security**: Implement robust security measures, especially considering the sensitive nature of the data being processed and stored.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the interaction between MinIO, Weaviate, and LangChain for high performance and efficient resource usage.
- **User Interface**: Depending on your application's requirements, design a user-friendly interface for interaction with the system.

This approach creates a powerful and versatile system that combines the strengths of MinIO's object storage capabilities, Weaviate's semantic search, and LangChain's language processing features.

Using LangChain Python library and minio and weaviate sdks - write a python script that does this

---

To create a Python script that integrates LangChain with MinIO and Weaviate SDKs, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Necessary Libraries**: 
   - Make sure you have LangChain, MinIO, and Weaviate Python libraries installed.
   ```bash
   pip install langchain minio weaviate-client
   ```

2. **Initialize MinIO and Weaviate Clients**:
   - Initialize the MinIO client to interact with your MinIO storage.
   - Initialize the Weaviate client to interact with the Weaviate vector database.

3. **LangChain Integration**:
   - Use LangChain to build a pipeline that interacts with both MinIO and Weaviate.

Here is a basic example script demonstrating how you might set up and use these components together:

```python
from minio import Minio
from weaviate.client import Client
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# Initialize MinIO Client
minio_client = Minio(
    "YOUR_MINIO_ENDPOINT",
    access_key="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",
    secret_key="YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
    secure=True  # Set to False if not using https
)

# Initialize Weaviate Client
weaviate_client = Client(
    url="YOUR_WEAVIATE_ENDPOINT",
    timeout_config=(5, 15)  # Optional: Configures timeouts for the Weaviate client
)

# Initialize LangChain LLM (OpenAI in this case)
llm = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Example function to process data
def process_data(data):
    # Use LangChain LLM to process data (e.g., generate summary, answer questions)
    # This is just a placeholder for your specific processing logic
    processed_data = llm(data)
    return processed_data

# Example MinIO operation
def fetch_data_from_minio(bucket_name, object_name):
    # Fetch data from MinIO
    try:
        response = minio_client.get_object(bucket_name, object_name)
        data = response.read()
        return data
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching data from MinIO: {e}")
        return None

# Example Weaviate operation
def index_data_in_weaviate(data, class_name):
    # Index data in Weaviate
    try:
        weaviate_client.data_object.create(
            data_object=data,
            class_name=class_name
        )
        print("Data indexed in Weaviate")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error indexing data in Weaviate: {e}")

# Example usage
bucket = "your-bucket-name"
object_key = "your-object-key"
class_name = "YourClassName"

data = fetch_data_from_minio(bucket, object_key)
if data:
    processed_data = process_data(data)
    index_data_in_weaviate(processed_data, class_name)
```

### Notes:
- Replace `"YOUR_MINIO_ENDPOINT"`, `"YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"`, `"YOUR_SECRET_KEY"`, `"YOUR_WEAVIATE_ENDPOINT"`, and `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual MinIO, Weaviate, and OpenAI credentials.
- The `process_data` function is a placeholder where you can add your specific logic using LangChain's LLM.
- This script is a basic framework. Depending on your specific use case, you might need to add error handling, logging, or other features.
- Ensure that your MinIO and Weaviate instances are correctly set up and accessible from the script.

This script forms a basic foundation for a more complex application that can be expanded upon based on your specific requirements.

Focusing on the `process_data(data)` function in the context of a Python application integrating LangChain, MinIO, and Weaviate, you have numerous options depending on your specific needs. Here's a generalized approach:

1. **Determine the Purpose of Data Processing**: 
   - First, decide what you want to achieve with the data. For instance, do you want to summarize it, extract key information, translate it, or perform some other language processing task?

2. **Use LangChain for Language Processing**:
   - LangChain is designed to enhance language models with external tools. You can use LangChain's capabilities to interact with OpenAI's GPT models or other language models to process your data.

Here is an example of how you might expand the `process_data(data)` function:

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# Initialize LangChain LLM (OpenAI in this case)
llm = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")

def process_data(data):
    """
    Process the given data using LangChain's LLM.

    Args:
    data (str): The data to be processed.

    Returns:
    str: The processed data.
    """
    # Define your processing logic here
    # For example, summarizing the text
    prompt = f"Summarize the following text: {data}"
    response = llm(prompt)

    # The response from the LLM can be further processed or directly returned
    processed_data = response.get("text", "")

    return processed_data
```

In this example, the `process_data` function is set up to summarize the text data. However, you can modify the prompt and the processing logic based on your application's needs, such as generating responses, answering questions, or any other language-based task.

Remember to replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual API key.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Handling Large Text**: If your data exceeds the token limit of the LLM, you might need to split the text or use techniques like `CombineDocuments` in LangChain.
- **Custom Processing Logic**: Depending on your use case, the processing logic can be customized extensively. LangChain offers various tools and techniques to augment the capabilities of language models.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues like API limits, network problems, or unexpected input data formats.

This function serves as a starting point and can be expanded or modified to suit a wide range of data processing requirements in your application.

write the def again with this version in mind

---

Using LangChain v0.1.0, the `process_data(data)` function can leverage the new features and improvements, such as improved observability, composability, and advanced output parsing. Here's how the function can be adapted:

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import create_extraction_chain_pydantic  # New in v0.1.0

# Initialize LangChain LLM (OpenAI in this case)
llm = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")

def process_data(data):
    """
    Process the given data using LangChain's LLM.

    Args:
    data (str): The data to be processed.

    Returns:
    str: The processed data.
    """
    # Define your processing logic here
    # For example, use an extraction chain to parse and structure the data
    extraction_chain = create_extraction_chain_pydantic(llm)
    
    # You can customize the chain to fit your specific processing needs
    processed_data = extraction_chain.run(data)

    return processed_data
```

In this example, `create_extraction_chain_pydantic` from LangChain v0.1.0 is used to create a chain that can extract and structure information from the provided data. This is just one of the many new functionalities in LangChain v0.1.0, and the exact implementation can vary based on your specific requirements.

1. **Initial Setup**: Import necessary libraries and initialize the clients for MinIO, Weaviate, and LangChain.
2. **Process Data Function**: Define a function to process data using LangChain's features.
3. **MinIO and Weaviate Operations**: Include functions to interact with MinIO for data retrieval and Weaviate for data indexing.

Here's a full script that encapsulates these steps:

```python
from minio import Minio
from weaviate.client import Client
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import create_extraction_chain_pydantic

# Initialize LangChain LLM (OpenAI in this case)
llm = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Initialize MinIO Client
minio_client = Minio(
    "YOUR_MINIO_ENDPOINT",
    access_key="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",
    secret_key="YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
    secure=True  # Set to False if not using https
)

# Initialize Weaviate Client
weaviate_client = Client(
    url="YOUR_WEAVIATE_ENDPOINT",
    timeout_config=(5, 15)  # Optional: Configures timeouts for the Weaviate client
)

def process_data(data):
    # Use LangChain v0.1.0 to process the data
    extraction_chain = create_extraction_chain_pydantic(llm)
    processed_data = extraction_chain.run(data)
    return processed_data

def fetch_data_from_minio(bucket_name, object_name):
    # Fetch data from MinIO
    try:
        response = minio_client.get_object(bucket_name, object_name)
        data = response.read()
        return data
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching data from MinIO: {e}")
        return None

def index_data_in_weaviate(data, class_name):
    # Index data in Weaviate
    try:
        weaviate_client.data_object.create(
            data_object=data,
            class_name=class_name
        )
        print("Data indexed in Weaviate")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error indexing data in Weaviate: {e}")

# Example usage
bucket = "your-bucket-name"
object_key = "your-object-key"
class_name = "YourClassName"

data = fetch_data_from_minio(bucket, object_key)
if data:
    processed_data = process_data(data)
    index_data_in_weaviate(processed_data, class_name)
```

### Notes:

- Replace the placeholders (`YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `YOUR_MINIO_ENDPOINT`, `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY`, `YOUR_SECRET_KEY`, `YOUR_WEAVIATE_ENDPOINT`) with your actual credentials and endpoints.
- The `process_data` function is utilizing LangChain v0.1.0 features for data extraction and structuring.
- Error handling is included for interactions with MinIO and Weaviate.

This script provides a basic structure for integrating these three powerful technologies. Depending on your specific requirements, you might want to add more advanced error handling, logging, or additional functionalities.

5. **Write Endpoint Functions**:
   - Write functions to handle MinIO data retrieval, Weaviate data indexing, and data processing using LangChain.

6. **Run LangServe**:
   - Start the LangServe server to make your application accessible via API calls.

Here's an example of how your complete Python script might look:

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.servables import FastAPIWrapper
from langchain.runnables import Runnable
from minio import Minio
from weaviate.client import Client
import openai

# Initialize clients
minio_client = Minio("YOUR_MINIO_ENDPOINT", access_key="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY", secret_key="YOUR_SECRET_KEY", secure=True)
weaviate_client = Client(url="YOUR_WEAVIATE_ENDPOINT")
llm = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")

# LangChain Runnable for processing data
class ProcessDataRunnable(Runnable):
    def run(self, bucket_name, object_name):
        # Fetch data from MinIO and process it
        response = minio_client.get_object(bucket_name, object_name)
        data = response.read()
        processed_data = llm(data)  # Use LangChain LLM to process data
        return processed_data

# LangChain Runnable for indexing data in Weaviate
class IndexDataRunnable(Runnable):
    def run(self, data, class_name):
        # Index data in Weaviate
        weaviate_client.data_object.create(data_object=data, class_name=class_name)
        return "Data indexed in Weaviate"

# Set up LangServe
app = FastAPIWrapper()
app.add_runnable("/process_data", ProcessDataRunnable())
app.add_runnable("/index_data", IndexDataRunnable())

# Run LangServe
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

In this script:
- Replace placeholders with your actual credentials and endpoints.
- The `ProcessDataRunnable` fetches and processes data from MinIO using LangChain and OpenAI's GPT.
- The `IndexDataRunnable` indexes processed data in Weaviate.
- LangServe exposes these functionalities as API endpoints.

```

In this script:
- Replace `"MINIO_ENDPOINT"`, `"MINIO_ACCESS_KEY"`, `"MINIO_SECRET_KEY"`, `"WEAVIATE_ENDPOINT"`, and `"OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual configuration details.
- `ProcessDataRunnable` now lists and processes all objects in a specified MinIO bucket and indexes the processed data in Weaviate.

This script provides a foundational structure to build upon for your specific application needs.

# Bucket Transformation

To use MinIO buckets as Weaviate indexes, you can modify the application so that each object stored in MinIO is treated as an individual entry in Weaviate. Essentially, the idea is to map each object in the MinIO bucket to a corresponding Weaviate class. Here's an approach:

1. **Define a Weaviate Schema Class**: Create a class in Weaviate that represents the data structure of the objects you're storing in MinIO. This includes defining properties that are relevant to your data.

2. **Fetch Data from MinIO**: Use the `list_objects` method to retrieve objects from MinIO. For each object, fetch its content using `get_object`.

3. **Process and Index Data in Weaviate**: For each object fetched from MinIO, process the data as needed (e.g., extract relevant information, format it) and then use Weaviate's client to add this data as an instance of the defined class in Weaviate.

4. **Search and Query Data**: Once your data is indexed in Weaviate, you can leverage its powerful search and ML functionalities to query and analyze the data.

Note: This approach assumes that the data in MinIO is structured in a way that's compatible with your Weaviate schema. You may need to implement data transformation logic if this is not the case.

---

There isn't a direct guide or established best practice specifically for using MinIO objects as Weaviate data sources. However, you can achieve this by creating a process where data from MinIO is used to populate Weaviate's data structure. Here's a conceptual approach to do this:

1. **Define Weaviate Schema**: 
   - Create a class in Weaviate that represents the data you're storing in MinIO. This includes properties that correspond to the data in MinIO objects.

2. **Fetch and Transform Data from MinIO**:
   - Use `list_objects` and `get_object` methods from MinIO client to retrieve objects from a MinIO bucket.
   - Transform the data retrieved from MinIO into a format compatible with your Weaviate schema.

3. **Index Data in Weaviate**:
   - Use Weaviate's client to index this transformed data. Each object from MinIO becomes an instance of the defined class in Weaviate.

4. **Querying and Searching Data**:
   - Leverage Weaviate's search and query capabilities to work with this data.

Here's a simplified code example to demonstrate this process:

```python
from minio import Minio
from weaviate.client import Client

# Initialize MinIO and Weaviate clients
minio_client = Minio("MINIO_ENDPOINT", access_key="MINIO_ACCESS_KEY", secret_key="MINIO_SECRET_KEY", secure=True)
weaviate_client = Client(url="WEAVIATE_ENDPOINT")

# Function to transform MinIO data for Weaviate
def transform_data_for_weaviate(minio_data):
    # Transformation logic here
    # This needs to be customized based on the data structure and requirements
    return transformed_data

# List and process objects from MinIO, then index in Weaviate
bucket_name = "your-bucket-name"
objects = minio_client.list_objects(bucket_name, recursive=True)

for obj in objects:
    response = minio_client.get_object(bucket_name, obj.object_name)
    data = response.read()
    
    # Transform data for Weaviate
    weaviate_data = transform_data_for_weaviate(data)

    # Index data in Weaviate
    weaviate_client.data_object.create(
        data_object=weaviate_data, 
        class_name="YourWeaviateClassName"
    )
```

In this code:
- Replace `"MINIO_ENDPOINT"`, `"MINIO_ACCESS_KEY"`, `"MINIO_SECRET_KEY"`, and `"WEAVIATE_ENDPOINT"` with your actual configuration details.
- The `transform_data_for_weaviate` function needs to be implemented based on how you want to process and structure your MinIO data for Weaviate.

This approach assumes that the structure of data in MinIO is consistent and can be mapped effectively to a Weaviate schema. The transformation logic will vary based on the nature of your data.


---

To complete the `transform_data_for_weaviate` function, let's assume that you have different types of data in separate buckets in MinIO, and each type of data needs a specific transformation logic before being indexed into Weaviate.

The function will need to identify the bucket from which the data is coming and apply the relevant transformation logic accordingly. Here's how you can structure this function:

```python
def transform_data_for_weaviate(minio_data, bucket_name):
    # Check the bucket name and apply corresponding transformation logic
    if bucket_name == "bucket1":
        # Transformation logic for data from bucket1
        transformed_data = transform_for_bucket1(minio_data)
    elif bucket_name == "bucket2":
        # Transformation logic for data from bucket2
        transformed_data = transform_for_bucket2(minio_data)
    # ... additional buckets and their transformations
    else:
        # Default transformation or handling for unknown bucket types
        transformed_data = default_transformation(minio_data)

    return transformed_data

def transform_for_bucket1(data):
    # Custom transformation logic for bucket1
    # This should be implemented based on the data structure in bucket1
    return transformed_data_for_bucket1

def transform_for_bucket2(data):
    # Custom transformation logic for bucket2
    # This should be implemented based on the data structure in bucket2
    return transformed_data_for_bucket2

def default_transformation(data):
    # Default transformation logic for data
    # This could be a generic transformation or a simple pass-through
    return data
```

In this example:
- `transform_for_bucket1`, `transform_for_bucket2`, etc., are placeholder functions where you should implement the specific logic to transform data based on the structure and requirements of each MinIO bucket.
- The `transform_data_for_weaviate` function checks the `bucket_name` and delegates the transformation to the appropriate function.
- Replace `"bucket1"`, `"bucket2"`, etc., with the actual names of your MinIO buckets.
- Implement each transformation function (`transform_for_bucket1`, `transform_for_bucket2`, etc.) based on how you want to process and structure your MinIO data for Weaviate.

This approach allows you to handle different data structures from various buckets with customized processing, making your data suitable for indexing in Weaviate.

---

Developing a production-level engine for transforming data from various MinIO buckets and preparing it for Weaviate indexing involves several key steps and considerations. Let's break down this task into a structured approach:

1. **Define Data Structures**:
   - Clearly define the data structures in each MinIO bucket. Understand the format, fields, and type of data (text, JSON, binary, etc.).
   - Determine how each data structure maps to your Weaviate schema.

2. **Implement Transformation Logic**:
   - For each bucket, write a transformation function. This function should parse the data from MinIO and transform it into a format compatible with your Weaviate schema.
   - Consider edge cases and error handling. Ensure that the transformation logic is robust and can handle anomalies in the data.

3. **Optimize for Performance**:
   - If dealing with large datasets, optimize your transformation functions for performance. This might include efficient parsing algorithms, using parallel processing, or batch processing techniques.

4. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Implement logging to track the transformation process. This is crucial for debugging and understanding the system's behavior in production.
   - Consider setting up monitoring for the transformation process to quickly identify and address issues.

5. **Test Thoroughly**:
   - Before deploying, thoroughly test the transformation logic with a variety of data samples to ensure that it works as expected.

6. **Deployment Considerations**:
   - When deploying the system, consider factors like scalability, reliability, and maintenance. Ensure that the system can handle the expected load and can be easily updated as requirements change.

Here is a sample implementation considering the above points:

```python
import json
import logging

# Sample transformation logic for different buckets
def transform_for_bucket1(data):
    # Assuming data is in JSON format for bucket1
    try:
        parsed_data = json.loads(data)
        # Perform specific transformation
        transformed_data = {
            "field1": parsed_data["some_field"],
            # ... other fields
        }
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        logging.error(f"JSON decoding error for bucket1: {e}")
        transformed_data = default_transformation(data)

    return transformed_data

def transform_for_bucket2(data):
    # Custom logic for bucket2
    # This logic might be different based on the data structure in bucket2
    # ...

    return transformed_data_for_bucket2

def default_transformation(data):
    # A simple pass-through or generic transformation
    logging.info("Default transformation applied")
    return {"content": data}

# Engine to transform data based on bucket name
def transform_data_for_weaviate(minio_data, bucket_name):
    transformation_function = {
        "bucket1": transform_for_bucket1,
        "bucket2": transform_for_bucket2,
        # ... map more buckets to their functions
    }.get(bucket_name, default_transformation)

    return transformation_function(minio_data)
```

In this implementation:
- Each bucket has a dedicated transformation function.
- A dictionary maps bucket names to their respective transformation functions, with a default transformation for unknown buckets.
- The code includes basic error handling and logging.

Remember, this is a simplified example. In a production environment, you would need to refine this further based on the actual structure of your data and operational requirements.

To complete the source code base, you need to configure custom logic for Weaviate schema classes that align with the data structures of your MinIO buckets. The Weaviate schema defines the structure of data that Weaviate can store and query. Here's a step-by-step guide to do this:

1. **Define Weaviate Schema Classes**:
   - Each class in Weaviate represents a type of data entity. For your application, you'll define classes that correspond to the types of data in your MinIO buckets.

2. **Create Weaviate Classes in Python**:
   - Use Weaviate's Python client to create these classes in your Weaviate instance.

3. **Map MinIO Data to Weaviate Classes**:
   - The transformation functions (`transform_for_bucket1`, `transform_for_bucket2`, etc.) should convert MinIO data into a format that matches the corresponding Weaviate class.

4. **Create Schema in Weaviate**:
   - Before running your application, ensure that the schema classes are created in Weaviate.

Here's how you might implement this:

### Step 1: Define Weaviate Schema Classes

Let's say you have two types of data in MinIO: "TextData" and "ImageData". You'll create two corresponding classes in Weaviate.

```python
text_data_schema = {
    "class": "TextData",
    "properties": [
        {"name": "title", "dataType": ["string"], "indexInverted": True},
        {"name": "content", "dataType": ["text"], "indexInverted": True}
    ]
}

image_data_schema = {
    "class": "ImageData",
    "properties": [
        {"name": "image_name", "dataType": ["string"], "indexInverted": True},
        {"name": "url", "dataType": ["string"], "indexInverted": True}
    ]
}
```

### Step 2: Create Weaviate Classes

Use Weaviate's Python client to create these classes.

```python
weaviate_client.schema.create_class(text_data_schema)
weaviate_client.schema.create_class(image_data_schema)
```

### Step 3: Map MinIO Data to Weaviate Classes

Transform the MinIO data to match these classes.

```python
def transform_for_bucket1(data):
    # Assuming this bucket contains text data
    # Extract title and content from data
    # Return the data in the format of the TextData class
    return {"title": extracted_title, "content": extracted_content}

def transform_for_bucket2(data):
    # Assuming this bucket contains image data
    # Extract image name and URL from data
    # Return the data in the format of the ImageData class
    return {"image_name": extracted_name, "url": extracted_url}
```

### Step 4: Create Schema in Weaviate

Ensure these classes exist in your Weaviate instance before running the application. This is typically done as a setup or deployment step.

This approach provides a structured way to integrate MinIO data with Weaviate by ensuring that the data transformation logic aligns with the defined Weaviate schema. Remember, the transformation logic will depend on the actual structure of your data in MinIO.

            response = minio_client.get_object(bucket_name, obj.object_name)
            data = response.read()
            # Transform data for Weaviate

            )
        return "Data processed and indexed"

# Set up LangServe
app = FastAPIWrapper()
app.add_runnable("/process_data", ProcessDataRunnable())

# Run LangServe
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

In this code:
- Replace `"MINIO_ENDPOINT"`, `"MINIO_ACCESS_KEY"`, `"MINIO_SECRET_KEY"`, `"WEAVIATE_ENDPOINT"`, and `"OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual configuration details.
- Implement the `transform_for_bucket1` and `transform_for_bucket2` functions according to the specific data structure in your MinIO buckets.
- The Weaviate schema classes (`TextData` and `ImageData`) are placeholders. You should modify them to reflect the actual data structures you are working
 with.
- `ProcessDataRunnable` lists objects from a specified MinIO bucket, transforms them, and indexes them in Weaviate.

This script is a foundational framework and should be adapted and extended based on your specific application requirements and data structures.

# Researching Retrieval

 LangChain, retrievers are interfaces that return documents based on unstructured queries. They're more general than vector stores, as they don't need to store documents but only retrieve them. LangChain offers several advanced retrievers, each with different use cases. Some key retrievers include:

- **Vectorstore**: This is the simplest retriever, ideal for beginners. It involves creating embeddings for each piece of text.
- **ParentDocument**: Useful for indexing smaller pieces of distinct information separately, but retrieving them together.
- **Multi Vector**: It creates multiple vectors for each document, which could include summaries or hypothetical questions.
- **Self Query**: This uses an LLM to transform user input into a string and metadata filter for retrieval, focusing on document metadata rather than content.
- **Contextual Compression**: It adds a post-processing step to refine retrieved documents, extracting only the most relevant information.
- **Time-Weighted Vectorstore**: Ideal for fetching recent documents based on semantic similarity and recency.
- **Multi-Query Retriever**: Generates multiple queries from the original one, fetching documents for each to better answer complex questions.

LangChain also allows for custom retriever creation, giving you the flexibility to tailor retrieval to your specific needs. For more details, you can visit the

LangChain offers a variety of retrievers, each suited for different use cases. Key retrievers include:

- **Vectorstore**: Simplest retriever, ideal for beginners, using text embeddings.
- **ParentDocument**: For indexing distinct smaller information chunks but retrieving them as a whole document.
- **Multi Vector**: Creates multiple vectors per document, useful for documents with diverse information types.
- **Self Query**: Utilizes an LLM for user input transformation, focusing on document metadata.
- **Contextual Compression**: Adds post-processing to refine retrieved documents, focusing on relevance.
- **Time-Weighted Vectorstore**: Suitable for fetching recent documents based on semantic similarity and time.
- **Multi-Query Retriever**: Generates multiple queries from one, useful for complex queries requiring multiple information types.

For custom retrieval needs, LangChain also supports creating custom retrievers. For detailed information on these retrievers and their use cases, visit the [LangChain Retrievers Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/).

# Creating our own Custom LLMs per Buckets

https://www.datasciencecentral.com/why-and-how-i-created-my-own-llm-from-scratch/

We could effectively encapsulate the "custom LLM data" in per bucket right?

Yes, encapsulating "custom LLM data" in per-bucket fashion in MinIO is a feasible approach. This method allows for organizing and managing the training data for your LLM more efficiently. Each bucket can contain data relevant to specific aspects or domains of your LLM, facilitating targeted training and updates. This approach also offers scalability, enabling you to expand or modify the data set as needed, without disrupting the entire system. It's an effective way to maintain and update the training data for your custom LLM, especially when integrated with systems like Weaviate for advanced data management and retrieval.

To extend your source code for incorporating LangChain's data retrieval methods, you would integrate specific retrievers from LangChain's library. These retrievers can be used to fetch and process data from various sources, and then store or index this data in MinIO and Weaviate. 

Here's an extended version of your code that includes LangChain retrieval methods:

```python
# [Existing imports]

# Additional Imports for LangChain Retrievers
from langchain.retrievers import ElasticsearchRetriever, WeaviateRetriever, LocalRetriever

# [Existing setup code for OpenAI, MinIO, Weaviate, and LangChain Tools]

# Initialize LangChain Retrievers
es_retriever = ElasticsearchRetriever(es_client=your_es_client)  # Set up your Elasticsearch client
weaviate_retriever = WeaviateRetriever(weaviate_client)
local_retriever = LocalRetriever(local_data_path="path/to/your/local/data")

# Add retrievers to the tools list
tools.extend([
    Tool(name="Elasticsearch Retriever", func=es_retriever.retrieve, description="Retrieve data from Elasticsearch"),
    Tool(name="Weaviate Retriever", func=weaviate_retriever.retrieve, description="Retrieve data from Weaviate"),
    Tool(name="Local Retriever", func=local_retriever.retrieve, description="Retrieve data from local storage")
])

# [Existing LangChain Agent initialization code]

# [Existing Weaviate schema and transformation functions]

# [Existing ProcessDataRunnable class]

# [Existing FastAPI Setup and Runnable setup]

# [Existing code to run LangServe]
```

In this extension, I've added three different LangChain retrievers: ElasticsearchRetriever, WeaviateRetriever, and LocalRetriever. Each of these is initialized with its respective client or data source. These retrievers are then added to the list of tools available to your LangChain Agent.

You'll need to provide your specific Elasticsearch client, Weaviate client, and the path to your local data source to correctly initialize these retrievers.

For more detailed information on the retrievers available in LangChain and their specific functionalities, you can refer to the LangChain documentation [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/).

# Tips & Techniques

To build an application integrating LangChain with MinIO and Weaviate, you can draw inspiration from various examples and demonstrations available online. These include setting up Weaviate as a vector database for semantic search, utilizing LangChain for LLM augmentations and retrievals, and harnessing MinIO for efficient data storage.

For instance, one approach involves setting up Weaviate for similarity searches with scoring. This involves initializing a Weaviate client, configuring the vector store, and adding documents for retrieval. You can perform hybrid searches, combining keyword and vector-based search techniques, to retrieve relevant documents based on their semantic context [oai_citation:1,Weaviate | ️ Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/weaviate) [oai_citation:2,Weaviate Hybrid Search | ️ Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/retrievers/weaviate-hybrid).

In LangChain, you can use sequential chains to combine multiple LLM inferences in a structured manner. This allows for step-by-step processing of information, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the output. Techniques like `CombineDocuments` in LangChain help in managing large inputs beyond the token length limits of LLMs, using methods like Stuffing, Map Reduce, Refine, and Map Rerank [oai_citation:3,Combining LangChain and Weaviate | Weaviate - Vector Database](https://weaviate.io/blog/combining-langchain-and-weaviate).

Additionally, integrating vector-based similarity searches with LangChain can be achieved using different vector stores like Weaviate and OpenSearch. This setup allows for similarity searches against these databases, using OpenAI's GPT models for embeddings and search queries. You can execute similarity searches and compare the results from different vector stores, observing how they rank and retrieve relevant documents [oai_citation:4,Vector search using Langchain, Weaviate and OpenSearch - Luminis](https://www.luminis.eu/blog/vector-search-using-langchain-weaviate-and-opensearch/).

These examples provide a foundation for developing your application. You can adapt and extend these techniques based on your specific requirements, integrating LangChain, Weaviate, and MinIO to create a powerful, semantically aware, and efficient system.

minio_client = Minio("MINIO_ENDPOINT",
                     access_key="MINIO_ACCESS_KEY",
                     secret_key="MINIO_SECRET_KEY",
                     secure=True)

# Initialize Weaviate Client
weaviate_client = weaviate.Client(url="WEAVIATE_ENDPOINT",
                                  auth_client_secret=weaviate.AuthApiKey("WEAVIATE_API_KEY"))

# Initialize LangChain LLM
llm = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Define Weaviate schema classes
text_data_schema = {
    # ... Define the schema for TextData class
}

# Create Weaviate classes
weaviate_client.schema.create_class(text_data_schema)

# Define a LangChain SequentialChain
sequential_chain = SequentialChain([llm])

# Define a LangChain CombineDocuments Chain
combine_documents_chain = CombineDocuments(llm)

# Define a LangChain Weaviate Retriever
weaviate_retriever = WeaviateRetriever(weaviate_client)

# Define LangChain Runnable for processing and indexing data
class ProcessAndIndexDataRunnable(Runnable):
    def run(self, bucket_name):
        objects = minio_client.list_objects(bucket_name, recursive=True)
        for obj in objects:
            # Fetch data from MinIO and process it
            data = minio_client.get_object(bucket_name, obj.object_name).read()
            processed_data = sequential_chain.run(data.decode('utf-8'))
            # Index processed data in Weaviate
            weaviate_client.data_object.create(data_object={"content": processed_data}, class_name="TextData")
        return "Data processed and indexed"

# Set up LangServe
app = FastAPIWrapper()
app.add_runnable("/process_and_index_data", ProcessAndIndexDataRunnable())

# Run LangServe
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

In this script:
- Replace `"MINIO_ENDPOINT"`, `"MINIO_ACCESS_KEY"`, `"MINIO_SECRET_KEY"`, `"WEAVIATE_ENDPOINT"`, and `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual configuration details.
- Define the `text_data_schema` based on the data structure you plan to store in Weaviate.
- The `ProcessAndIndexDataRunnable` class processes data fetched from MinIO using a sequential chain in LangChain and then indexes this data in Weaviate.
- The script includes a FastAPI wrapper to create an API endpoint for the data processing and indexing functionality.

This script provides a foundational framework for your application. You can extend it to include additional features like similarity searches in Weaviate, advanced document combination techniques in LangChain, and more complex data transformation logics as per your specific application needs.

# Writing the code with Pydantic Models

For your application's code structure, incorporating "Objects" and "Function Classes" can be organized effectively using Pydantic's BaseModel for enhanced structure and validation. Here's a guideline for including them in your code:

1. **Objects**:
   - Objects are instances of classes and data structures. They're typically defined after importing the necessary libraries and modules and before or during the initialization of main components.
   - For instance, in a LangChain application, you may have objects representing configurations for MinIO, Weaviate, and LangChain settings. These can be organized as Pydantic models for better structure and validation.

2. **Function Classes**:
   - Function classes are custom classes that encapsulate specific functionalities within your application. These are usually written after setting up the main application components like OpenAI, MinIO, and Weaviate clients.
   - In your application, function classes like `ProcessDataRunnable` or any other custom runnable classes can be defined using Pydantic's BaseModel to ensure consistent data handling and validation.

3. **Using Pydantic BaseModels**:
   - Pydantic BaseModels are used to define data models with type validations. When you create objects or function classes, you can define their structure using Pydantic models.
   - For example, if you have a function class that processes data from MinIO and indexes it into Weaviate, you can define its input and output data structures as Pydantic models.

Here's a basic example to illustrate these points:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.retrievers import ElasticsearchRetriever, WeaviateRetriever, LocalRetriever
from minio import Minio
from weaviate.client import Client

# Define Pydantic models for configuration settings
class MinIOConfig(BaseModel):
    endpoint: str
    access_key: str
    secret_key: str
    secure: bool

class WeaviateConfig(BaseModel):
    url: str
    api_key: str

# Initialize your configurations
minio_config = MinIOConfig(
    endpoint="MINIO_ENDPOINT",
    access_key="MINIO_ACCESS_KEY",
    secret_key="MINIO_SECRET_KEY",
    secure=True
)

weaviate_config = WeaviateConfig(
    url="WEAVIATE_ENDPOINT",
    api_key="WEAVIATE_API_KEY"
)

# Initialize MinIO and Weaviate clients using Pydantic models
minio_client = Minio(
    minio_config.endpoint,
    access_key=minio_config.access_key,
    secret_key=minio_config.secret_key,
    secure=minio_config.secure
)

weaviate_client = Client(
    url=weaviate_config.url,
    auth_client_secret=weaviate_config.api_key
)

# [Initialize OpenAI, LangChain Tools, and LangChain Retrievers as previously defined]

# Define Function Classes with Pydantic BaseModels
class ProcessDataRequest(BaseModel):
    bucket_name: str
    object_name: str

class ProcessDataResponse(BaseModel):
    message: str

class ProcessDataRunnable(Runnable):
    def run(self, request: ProcessDataRequest) -> ProcessDataResponse:
        # [Implement the logic to process and index data]
        return ProcessDataResponse(message="Data processed and indexed")

# [Existing FastAPI Setup and Runnable setup]
# [Existing code to run LangServe]
```

# Keep in mind when writing code

It seems like you're ready to proceed with the development of your application that integrates LangChain with MinIO and Weaviate, using Python and Pydantic models. Here are some key steps and best practices to keep in mind as you move forward with the development:

1. **Code Organization and Structure**:
   - Keep your code well-organized and modular. This not only makes it easier to manage but also simplifies debugging and maintenance.
   - Group related functionalities into classes and modules. For instance, all MinIO-related operations can be encapsulated in a specific module or class.

2. **Implementing Pydantic Models**:
   - Use Pydantic models to enforce type checking and validation. This adds a layer of robustness to your application by ensuring that data conforms to expected formats.
   - Define clear models for your inputs and outputs, especially
   - For each API endpoint or data processing function, define Pydantic models that clearly describe the structure of input data and the format of the response. This ensures consistency in how data is received and sent by your application.

3. **Developing Custom Function Classes**:
   - For each core functionality (like processing and indexing data), create dedicated classes or functions. This modular approach makes the codebase scalable and easier to modify.
   - Implement error handling within these classes to manage and log exceptions, ensuring your application can gracefully handle unexpected scenarios.

4. **Integration Testing**:
   - Regularly test the integration points between MinIO, Weaviate, and LangChain. This helps in identifying and resolving issues early in development.
   - Ensure the correct operation of your application by testing how MinIO, Weaviate, and LangChain work together. This involves testing the flow of data from MinIO to the processing logic in LangChain and finally to the indexing and retrieval in Weaviate.
   - Use unit tests and integration tests to cover various scenarios and edge cases. Tools like `pytest` can be helpful for writing and managing these tests.

5. **API Development with FastAPI**:
   - Utilize FastAPI to create efficient, asynchronous API endpoints for your application. FastAPI's automatic request validation using Pydantic models can greatly simplify your API development.
   - Ensure that each endpoint is well-documented, taking advantage of FastAPI's built-in support
